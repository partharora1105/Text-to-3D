# Text-to-3D (Work in Progress)

Text-to-3D is an ongoing project exploring the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and 3D graphics. This implementation aims to transform textual descriptions into detailed and visually appealing 3D models. Leveraging OpenAI for image sampling, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D model generation, Marching Cubes for mesh rendering, and a texture generation process, the project provides a comprehensive pipeline for converting text-based concepts into immersive 3D representations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on Google Colab:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/partharora1105/Text-to-3D.git
   ```

2. Open the `Text_to_3D.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the pipeline and generate 3D models from text.

You can also access the public [Google Collab Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u1q22nGkRM8hS20DIDkusxcdeEX1acYc?usp=sharing)

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to input text and visualize the generated 3D models.
3. Provide feedback on the generated models for iterative refinement.
